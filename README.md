## [Live Demo](https://findmejazz.herokuapp.com/) â€¢ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLdCrWnmng)

A MERN stack jazz discovery app using TypeScript, the Spotify API and web SDK, React Router Dom, Redux Toolkit, MongoDB and Mongoose.

### Current Features:

- [x] Sign-in using the Spotify Authorisation Code Flow
- [x] Token storage and automatic refreshing (single sign-in)
- [x] Search (my) database for tracks by instrument

- [ ] Search by (discovered) artist (possible restructuring of database relations)
- [ ] Admin panel with CRUD functionality
- [ ] Refactor / fill in missing TypeScript type declarations

## Challenges

I love using new technologies in personal projects which I want to learn. This is my first TypeScript app, but in retrospect I was destined to add some `@ts-ignore` as Spotify doesn't provide types for their web SDK.

Functionality of the app is quite simple, but the effort was put in to the code for a clean user interface (something I considered a challenge) and seamless authorisation. I've also designed this 'mobile first', especially as the dip-in-and-out nature of the app suits mobile use far more than desktop.

This project was made in 2 and a half weeks working in the evenings around the [School of Applied Technology](https://www.salt.study/our-hubs) coding bootcamp.
